## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Files are encrypted using AES-256, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.
- **JWT Authentication**: Users must authenticate with a JWT token before storing or accessing files.
- **Virus Scanning**: Each file is checked for viruses to enhance security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with usability in mind for seamless file sharing.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on various operating systems, making it accessible to everyone.

## Technologies Used

- **AES**: Advanced Encryption Standard for secure file encryption.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
- **Node.js**: Server-side platform for building the application.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to create the API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data and file metadata.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.
- **ClamAV**: Antivirus engine for scanning files.

## Installation

To get started with Secure File Sharing, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jacobPRO123/secure_file_sharing.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd secure_file_sharing
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   ```

5. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it via the API or the front-end interface. 

### API Endpoints

- **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT token.
- **POST /api/files/upload**: Upload a file after authentication.
- **GET /api/files/:id**: Download a file using its ID.

For more detailed usage, refer to the [API Documentation](https://github.com/jacobPRO123/secure_file_sharing/wiki/API-Documentation).

## How It Works

### File Upload Process

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in using their credentials. If successful, they receive a JWT token.
2. **File Upload**: The user uploads a file, which is then encrypted using AES-256.
3. **Virus Scanning**: The file is scanned for viruses using ClamAV.
4. **Storage**: If the file passes the virus scan, it is stored in MongoDB with its metadata.

### File Download Process

1. **User Authentication**: The user must provide a valid JWT token to access files.
2. **File Retrieval**: The application retrieves the encrypted file from the database.
3. **Decryption**: The file is decrypted using AES-256 before being sent to the user.
